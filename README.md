The primary motive of this project is to harness the power of machine learning to
revolutionize weather forecasting. By leveraging historical weather data stored in CSV format,
the program aims to predict future weather conditions with remarkable accuracy. Through the
seamless integration of cutting-edge technologies, this project seeks to redefine how weather
predictions are made, offering a glimpse into the future of meteorological science.
